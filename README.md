# Image-colourisation-using-Conditional-GAN

This project uses a conditional GAN to convert grayscale images into colour images. The generator was fed a grayscale image and was tasked to produce the output in the LAB format. The discriminator was fed a concatenation of the grayscale image and its LAB counterpart, and was tasked to recognise the true images from synthetically generated ones. The architecture of the GAN follows that of the U-Net mode.
